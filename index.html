            <h2>Hi, I'm Jack, an aspiring software engineer and current student at the University of Akron!</h2>
            <p>If I had to claim a specialty, it would have to be in a backend or embedded environment and at the lowest level of high level code. However, I also have a strong passion for system design and recently CI/CD.</p>
            <h3>But that's not all!</h3>
            <p>In my 7 years of amateur and academic programming experience, I have come to love everything about the process of translating the wants and needs of people into software solutions that improve their lives. Recently, I've gained a greater appreciation for this through contributing to the learning of my peers both as an officer in the newly founded ZipCode programming club at the University of Akron.</p>
            <p>For more of my technical experience, check out some of my <a href="public/pages/projects.html">projects</a> or my <a href="public/pages/resume.html">resume</a>. Feel free to shoot me an email as well if you have any questions. I'm always happy to help other developers navigate the ever evolving world of software!</p>
            <h3>I'm also just a chill dude though.</h3>
            <p>When I'm not writing or researching code, I like to watch and play soccer (Visca el Bar√ßa!), as well as several online games like VALORANT and Apex Legends. I also have a loose interest in philosophy and enjoy getting lost in critical thought about how to appropriately navigate the nuance of a world that has suddenly found itself in a turbulent sea of information brought about by this technology I so love.</p>
